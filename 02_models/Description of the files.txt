model.R : implementation of the model, take model parameters (e.g. transmission rate) and produce outputs (e.g. number of infected colonies)

sampling : produce de set of parameters according LHS and produce a dataframe with the parameters, the scenario and the outputs

param_ranges : ranges of the parameters in which the Latin Hypercube Sampling is performed

scenarios : dataframe with the description of the scenarios

regression_trees_on_scnearios : for each scenario, application of regresion trees on its outputs

best strategy: for a specific set of parameters, which scenario is the best ? Application of an classifation trees
